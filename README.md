# welcome!
This repository is intended to store our governance documents.  

For the time being that primarily consists of our draft Manifesto:

We will be bootstrapping this community, relying on each other, to bring more openness to the cyber security industry.

We want to provide a place that practioners - including especially security engineers - can learn about and help to build better solutions to pernicious problems.
We are also extremely keen to enable the adoption of deep learning in ways that improve the productivity of security engineering and operations.

In practice that will mean:
- builders of projects walking through their approach
- new projects being hosted here
- hackathons being run here to support any number of open security projects

Together we can - and must - improve the productivity of cyber security.
